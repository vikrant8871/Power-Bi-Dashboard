To create a cryptocurrency dashboard in Power BI, we done these steps:


First, imported the cryptocurrency dataset containing the columns described earlier into Power BI.

Clean and transform the data: Cleaned the data by removing any missing or invalid values, and transform the data by creating calculated columns such as daily percentage change or moving averages. You can use the Power Query Editor in Power BI to perform these tasks.

Created visualizations: Created visualizations such as line charts, Chard charts, and KPI to display the cryptocurrency High,low and avgrage value. You can customize the visualizations by selecting the appropriate fields for the X and Y axes, adding filters, and setting the color scheme.

Added interactive elements: Added interactive elements such as slicers, Cards, and buttons to allow users to filter and drill down into the data. You can use the Selection Pane in Power BI to manage these elements.
